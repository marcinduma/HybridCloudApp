# Connectivity Check

## 1. Lab access general description

The lab has been built leveraging multiple cloud environments as following:

- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud
- Private intrastructure on-prem

You will have access to Cisco Container Platform GUI, where you will setup new Kubernetes Clusters deployed in AWS, GKE and On-Prem. In the end you will manage your application that will be deployed in 3 different environments. In this lab you will see how to connect microservices together to make whole application work.
Most of the tasks you will do from Linux Jumphost that is running on-premise. From there you will deploy components of your application in Kubernetes Cluster in AWS, GKE and on-premise.

## 2. Cisco dCloud dashboard

The entire lab for the session is built using Cisco dCloud environment. To access it, you need to login to dCloud dashboard first. To do so, open https://dcloud.cisco.com in your browser.

## 3. Accessing Linux Jumphost

Open PuTTY client or any equivalent SSH client on your desktop.

Enter following IP address, make sure SSH is the selected protocol.

    Computer: 198.18.1.50
    User name: student
    User password: C1sco12345


## 4. Accessing Cisco Container Platform

Cisco Container Platform manages Kuberenetes clusters in the private infrasturcture. You will have access to dedicated instance of Cisco Container Platform, from which you will manage your own Kuberenetes Clusters used later on to deploy application.

Please find login credentials and URL to your CCP instance below:

    URL: https://198.18.1.100
    User name: admin
    User password: L1ons@svs

> **You can explore CCP through the GUI, but please do not delete content already created.**

## 5. Accessing CSR1kv Lab router

Your session contain Cisco CSR1kv router. It will be used to terminate Site-2-Site tunnels with AWS and GCP tenants. The VPN configuration will be generated by cloud platforms and then copied to the CLI.

Please find login credentials and IP address to your CSR1kv router below - use SSH:

    Computer: 198.18.1.254
    User name: student
    User password: C1sco12345

> **Do not delete configuration already existing on the router.**

## 6. Accessing vCenter for Lab

Whole setup is done on ESXi in Cisco dCloud environment. During the lab you don't need to perform actions on vCenter itself. However for case of troubleshooting or exploration, credentials to your vCenter below.

    URL: https://vc65.demo.dcloud.cisco.com/ui
    User name: administrator
    User password: C1sco12345!

> **Do not delete configuration nor VM machines already existing on the vCenter.**

## 7. Google Cloud access
